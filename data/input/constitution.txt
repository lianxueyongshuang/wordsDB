I used to be a humble girl, the thing is that I am too humble, I always think that my ability is not good enough, but in fact, I am just not confident. One day, when I went back home after school, my mother asked me to help her, she had some problems with the computer. I helped her to solve her problems, she said I was so great, I knew so much things. Until then did I realize that I should be confident, I have ability to do some things. When people give me compliment, I will accept and say thank you, I am confident now. I believe in myself, I wonâ€™t be defeated by the difficulty.
